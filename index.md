Hi y'all, I'm Kori, a Computer Science Cybersecurity student at Loyola University New Orleans. I'm a results-driven nerd who likes creating, being resourceful, and improving what already exists. I'm always asking questions. I'm currently looking for a software development or related internship that offers learning and growth.
